    ==========
    This file integrates the OpenAI API into the GenieAI application. 
    It initializes the OpenAI client, defines configurations, and provides the `runChat` function 
    for sending user prompts to the OpenAI API and returning a styled, genie-like response.

    Key Features:
    - Connects to the OpenAI API using the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
    - Customizes responses with a predefined "genie" persona that is energetic, humorous, 
      charismatic, and informative.
    - Manages errors gracefully, providing user-friendly fallback messages.

    Dependencies:
    - `openai` library for OpenAI API communication.
    - Environment variables for secure API key storage.

 * Initialize the OpenAI client with API configurations.

 * - `apiKey`: The API key is securely loaded from environment variables (VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY).
 * - `dangerouslyAllowBrowser`: Enables usage of OpenAI's API in browser-based applications.
